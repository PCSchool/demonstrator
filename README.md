<h1>Sleep Signal Demonstrator</h1>
<h5>Prototype for the Sleep Signal Viewer</h5>

<p>The application the Sleep Signal Demonstrator is part of the assignment for the internship. The demonstrator is build within Qt(qt5), part of the assignment is to find out if Qt is qualified for the functionalities for the Sleep Signal Viewer.</p>
<p>For the functionality, the demonstrator will be used to store, progress, analyze, visualize data and capable to convert the data stored into automatically generated reports.</p>
<br/><p>If there is something to be remarked about the code, feel free to tell.</p>

<h2>Introduction internship</h2>
<p>The internship took place from 4 February till 21 July 2018. This internship takes place into the sector Software Engineering, the program of the 4 year HBO program that I(sup :) conduct at the academy Fontys in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The internship exist of two assignments: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Research for modern technologies(frameworks, libraries) to use for the Sleep Signal Demonstrator. </li>
  <ul>Select one framework and one of more libraries.</ul>
  <li>Create the Sleep Signal Demonstrator with the modern technology selected from the research.</li>
  <ul>Create the demonstrator with its basic functionality.</ul>
</ol>
<p>The Sleep Signal Demonstrator is a medical software application that serves as the prototype for the Sleep Signal Viewer and is capable to progress, filter, record and visualize the data it receives. The internship ends at 22 July 2018. </p>

<h2>Use of digital processing filters</h2>
<p>Within this project there is made use of digital processing filters. The digital processing filters classes are from the following Github project:</p>
